# :robot: SalesGPT - Your Context-Aware AI Sales Assistant

This repo demonstrates an implementation of a **context-aware** AI Sales Assistant using LLMs.

SalesGPT is context-aware, which means it can understand what section of a sales conversation it is in and act accordingly.
Morever, SalesGPT has access to tools, such as your own pre-defined product knowledge base, significantly reducing hallucinations!

We leverage the [`langchain`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) library in this implementation, specifically [Custom Agent Configuration](https://langchain-langchain.vercel.app/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_agent_with_tool_retrieval) and are inspired by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) architecture.

## Our Vision: Build the Best Open-Source Autonomous Sales Agent

We are building SalesGPT to power your best Autonomous Sales Agents. Hence, we would love to learn more about use cases you are building towards which will fuel SalesGPT development roadmap.

**If you want us to build better towards your needs, please fill out our 45 seconds [SalesGPT Use Case Survey](https://5b7mfhwiany.typeform.com/to/xmJbWIjG)**

## Product Knowledge Base

The AI Sales Agent has access to tools, such as your internal Product Knowledge base.
This allows the agent to only talk about your own products and significantly reduces hallucinations.

## Understanding Context

The AI Sales Agent understands the conversation stage (you can define your own stages fitting your needs):

- Introduction: Start the conversation by introducing yourself and your company. 
- Qualification: Qualify the prospect by confirming if they are the right person to talk to regarding your product/service.
- Value proposition: Briefly explain how your product/service can benefit the prospect. 
- Needs analysis: Ask open-ended questions to uncover the prospect's needs and pain points. 
- Solution presentation: Based on the prospect's needs, present your product/service as the solution that can address their pain points.
- Objection handling: Address any objections that the prospect may have regarding your product/service. 
- Close: Ask for the sale by proposing a next step. 
- End Conversation: The user does not want to continue the conversation, so end the call.
 
As such, this agent can have a natural sales conversation with a prospect and behaves based on the conversation stage. Hence, this notebook demonstrates how we can use AI to automate sales development representatives activites, such as outbound sales calls.

## SalesGPT Roadmap


- Add the ability of Sales Agent to interact with AI plugins on your website (.well-known/ai-plugin.json)

- What tools should the agent have? (e.g., the ability to search the internet)

~~-
 Add the ability to stop generation when user interupts the agent~~

~~- Add a vectorstore to incorporate a real product knowledge base vs. the LLM making it up.~~

~~- Knowledge base for products/services a Sales Agent can offer (so that LLM does not make it up)~~

~~- Convert LLM Chains (linear workflow) to an Agent (decides what to do based on user's input)~~
